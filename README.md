Hi Developers!
Vinay here,i am currently pursuing my BE graduation in Computer to be completed by 2019.
My interest is to work with developers community around.
I normally work with C,C++,Java,Python,HTML and always engaged in learning upcomming new technologies and languages.
As our Final Year Project we are currently working on Building Flight Delay Insurance System.
A system that will give tokens as compensation for every minute delay of Flights Booked by passengers.
So we will be using Solilidity to implement Smart Contracts inturn working on BlockChain Technology.
Hoping to get help from developers across.
